The sun sets behind the mountains; the Yellow River flows to the sea.
Green hills stretch far, white rivers gleam; in cuckoo's cry, rain falls like misty dream.
Sunset clouds fly with a lone wild duck; autumn river blends with sky in one hue.
Mountain air glows at dusk, as birds return together.
Spring slumber ignores dawn, till birdsong fills the morn.
Sunrise paints river flowers redder than flame; spring turns the water greener than indigo.
Beyond green hills, more hills; beyond towers, more towers—When will West Lake’s song and dance fade?
Moon sets, crows cry under frosty sky;By maples and fishing lamps, I lie awake sighing.
One night of longing spans the world apart;In dreams, a thousand miles—cold moon on my heart.
Clouded country paths fade to black;On the river, a lone boat’s lamp glows back.
In second-month skies, grass grows tall and orioles fly;Willow caress dykes, drunk on spring’s haze.
Spring wind greens the south bank once more—When will the bright moon light my homeward shore?
Frost falls, the river chills;Maple leaves cling to green, reluctant still.
Apricot rain almost soaks my sleeves;Willow breeze brushes my face, soft and cool.
Over the sea, the bright moon rises high;Though worlds apart, we share this same sky.
Cicadas’ drone deepens the wood’s hush;Birds’ songs make the mountain’s silence more lush.
Lake gleams with autumn moon in harmony;Windless, its surface—an unpolished mirror’s clarity.
The river flows beyond heaven and earth;Mountain hues flicker between being and nothingness.
A slanting sunset spreads on the water, half the river green, half the river red.
The great river eastward flows, its waves having worn away.
Behold, ten thousand mountains turned red, forests layered in dyed hues.
Four hundred and eighty temples of the Southern Dynasties, how many towers in mist and rain remain?
